# **DISCLAIMER**

Octocats are a trademark of GitHub. In no way do my octocats give you a right to
misinterpret my feeble art to imply that I am affiliated with GitHub (other than
really appreciating their services) nor to imply that I have any other right to
use the octocat theme than GitHub's gracious offer to use octocats to show my â™¥
for GitHub.

Unfortunately, I just found out that you are [not supposed to modify the octocat](https://github.com/logos).

With that disclaimer in mind, you have the license to look at the following octocats, but not to do anything else with them. They were made in a purely recreational spirit.

Under the same license, this one, too:
